Web App
=========================

`npm install`
`npm test`

You need to use SSL for this app cause its going to be over the Web.
When you run this script, just press 'Enter' a lot, you don't need any details unless you are going to pass this stuff to an actual signing authority.

`sh create_cert.sh`

Then read the code and build an app using it :)
